# BackMyGame 🎮💰

Welcome to **BackMyGame**! 🎉 A decentralized **crowdlending** platform where you can back your favorite gaming campaigns and help them thrive, built on the **Linea Sepolia** test network. Whether you're a gamer or just someone who loves supporting cool projects, this platform lets you help games reach their funding goals—by lending, not just donating! 🚀

## Features 🌟
- **Crowdlending for Gaming Campaigns:** Ready to be a hero? 💪 Lend funds to exciting game campaigns. Your contribution could bring back a big return! 💸
- **Web3 Integration:** Built using **Solidity** smart contracts on the **Linea Sepolia** test network. ⚡
- **Transparent Transactions:** Blockchain ensures that everything is transparent—because no one likes secrets (except for plot twists in games). 🎮🔎

## Technologies Used 🛠️
- **Solidity** for smart contract development (because we're serious about contracts). 💼
- **Linea Sepolia** test network for blockchain interactions (it’s like the sandbox, but cooler). 🏖️
- **Next.js** for frontend development (because speed matters). ⚡
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling (looking good is a must). 😎
- **Ethers.js** for blockchain communication (no need to speak Solidity—just let the code do the talking). 🗣️

## Getting Started 🚀

### Prerequisites 🔑
Before you dive in, make sure you've got these installed:
- Node.js (version 16 or higher)
- npm (Node Package Manager) for managing packages
- A wallet extension like **MetaMask**, ready to roll on the **Linea Sepolia** test network. 🦊💼

### Running the Demo 🎬

1. **Clone the repository:**

   First, grab the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/manovHacksaw/BackMyGame.git
   cd BackMyGame
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   Hop into the **client** directory:

   ```bash
   cd client
   ```

   Install all the necessary dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the demo:**

   Ready, set, go! 🎮

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the app on `http://localhost:3000`. Open your browser and voila! You've got a demo running.

### Interacting with the DApp 💻💎
- **Connect your wallet (MetaMask)** to the **Linea Sepolia** test network (where the magic happens). ✨
- Browse campaigns, find a game you want to back, and start contributing. Let’s help bring some great games to life! 🎮💸

## Future Plans 🚀🔮
- **Expanded Crowdlending Capabilities:** We're planning to introduce a feature where backers can earn a percentage return on their loan based on the campaign’s success! 🌱💵
- **Game Creator Dashboard:** Game creators will soon have their own dashboard to track campaign progress, interact with backers, and manage fund allocation. 📊🕹️
- **Multi-chain Support:** We’re looking into expanding the platform to support more blockchains beyond Linea Sepolia, so more users can get in on the action. 🌍
- **Campaign Rewards & Benefits:** Get ready for future features where backers will receive exclusive in-game rewards or early access to the games they back! 🏆🎮
